            <ul>
                <li>To participate in the competition, pre-registration is required at <a href="https://physicsbrawl.org">https://physicsbrawl.org</a>.</li>
                <li>By registering for the competition, each team agrees to follow the Rules of Conduct and these Rules of Physics Brawl Online and confirms they have made themselves acquainted with them.</li>
                <li>A team consists of 1-5 competitors.</li>
                <li>To compete in categories A, B, or C, all team members must be high-school students, primary school students, or their respective equivalents. There is also an Open category (non-competitive) for other competitors that do not meet the criteria for A, B, or C categories.</li>
                <li>Each contestant can compete in only one category and be a member of only one team (see Designation into Categories).</li>
                <li>The name of a team cannot spread political or religious views, cannot be insulting, or be in any other way inappropriate. The head organizer has a right to change the name of such a team, censor it, or disqualify the team completely.</li>
                <li>By registering in the competition, the team members agree with publishing the results of their team in the form of basic information (your name, surname, category, school, and points) in the results list in both print and digital outputs.</li>

            <h1>Designation into Categories</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>Teams compete in three categories; to which they are placed based on the following algorithm.</li>
                <li>Each contestant is assigned a coefficient based on the expected year of high school graduation. A contestant who is in the final, i.e., graduating, year of secondary education at the time of the competition (specifically, a school corresponding to level 3 of the ISCED 2011 classification) is assigned a coefficient of 4. A contestant in the penultimate year is assigned a coefficient of 3, and so on. The lowest possible coefficient is 0 (this is assigned to pupils of primary schools and the corresponding years of multi-year grammar schools).</li>
                <li>The coefficient of a team is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the coefficients of individual competitors (they are added together and divided by the number of competitors).</li>
                <li>The team is assigned the lowest category whose conditions it satisfies:
                    <ul>
                        <li>category A: team coefficient ≤ 4,</li>
                        <li>category B: team coefficient ≤ 3 and maximum two competitors have a coefficient 4,</li>
                        <li>category C: team coefficient ≤ 2, no member has a coefficient 4 and maximum two competitors have a coefficient 3.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If a team member cannot be assigned a coefficient according to the rules above, the team will automatically compete in the Open category.</li>
                <li>All categories share the same set of problems.</li>
                <li>Each category of the competition has a separate result list.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The competition is held exclusively online via the competition environment, which you can access from the Physics Brawl Online website. The link to the competition environment will also be sent to the contestants by email.</li>
                <li>The teams log in with their team password, which they will receive shortly before the beginning of the competition in an email message.</li>
                <li>Problems will be published in the form of PDF files in the competition environment after the start of the competition.</li>
                <li>Teams send the results directly via the competition environment. Results sent by other means (email, etc.) will not be accepted.</li>
                <li>Official announcements from the organizers will be communicated via the online board, only exceptionally by email. The teams are obliged to watch the online board.</li>
                <li>During the competition, the up-to-date results of all teams are posted. However, these will be hidden 20 minutes before the end of the competition.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The competition lasts 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Teams solve the problems. For each correct answer to a problem, the team receives a new problem from the particular series (unless the solved problem is the last problem in the series).</li>
                <li>The competition consists of two parallel parts - the Main series and the Hurry-up (consisting of three series); more details are below.</li>
                <li>The competition consists of 4 parallel series.</li>
                <li>Every problem is specified by the maximum score, which the team receives for submitting the correct answer on the first attempt. The maximum score the team can get for the particular problem lowers after submitting incorrect answers (see the Main series or the Hurry-up series).</li>
                <li>The team aims to receive as many points as possible.</li>
                <li>After an hour and a half into the competition, the option of skipping the problems activates.</li>
                <li>The team loses 1 point for skipping an unsolved problem in the series, and a new problem will become available. The skipped task can no longer be answered. Each team can skip up to 10 problems.</li>
                <li>If the team answers a problem incorrectly, they will not be allowed to submit an answer for 1 minute in that particular series.</li>
                <li>If a serious issue is discovered with a competition problem, organizers reserve the right to modify or eliminate it without compensation.</li>
                <li>During the competition, all competitors are allowed to communicate only with their team members or the organizers. Any interaction with teachers, other teams, etc. is strictly forbidden.</li>
                <li>An exception to the previous rule is the chat available in the game system, where the teams can ask questions related to the task formulations or any issues related to the game system or the competition. Organizers may publicly respond to these questions.</li>
                <li>In the chat and other official competition channels, it is strictly forbidden to give hints to other teams, discuss task solutions, spam, or express oneself inappropriately in any way. Violating this rule may lead to team penalties. All disputed situations are decided by the main organizer or an organizer appointed by him.</li>
                <li>The teams use computer(s) or other electronic equipment with access to the internet to solve the problems. Furthermore, teams are permitted to use calculators and writing or drafting supplies.</li>
                <li>Teams are permitted to use the internet and any literature as a source of information. The use of generative artificial intelligence tools is strictly prohibited. This includes but is not limited to, tools such as ChatGPT capable of generating complex, coherent, and contextually relevant answers to questions posed by the user.</li>
                <li>The competition is based on fair play. The course of the competition is monitored to prevent cheating.</li>
