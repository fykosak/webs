            <h1>ARTICLE 5: CATEGORIES</h1>

            <ol>
                <li>Fyziklani is run with three categories.</li>
                <li>Each category has a separate results table. All categories share the same problemset and the Rules.</li>
                <li>The teams are assigned to categories based on their team coefficients. The team coefficient is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the coefficients of individual members. Teams are automatically assigned to the lowest possible categories according to Art. 5 point 5.</li>
                <li>For international teams from states which use a significantly different system of education, the team coefficient is calculated using the expected year of completing the studies of level 3 of education according to the classification ISCED 2011 (International Standard Classification of Education). The coefficient of a student in his/her final year is 4, the coefficient of a student that should graduate in the next year is 3, and so on. The lowest possible coefficient is 0, for students with more than 4 years until graduation. In disputable cases, the head organizer may determine the coefficient of a participant.</li>
                <li>The categories of Fyziklani are as follows:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Category A &#8211; team coefficient &leq; 4,</li>
                        <li>Category B &#8211; team coefficient &leq; 3 and at most two team members have coefficient 4,</li>
                        <li>Category C &#8211; team coefficient &leq; 2, no team member has coefficient 4 and at most two members have coefficient 3.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The highest category is category A, a lower one is B and the lowest one is C.</li>
                <li>During registration, a team may choose to participate in the highest category A, regardless of its team coefficient.</li>
                <li>Any changes in team composition or assignment to a different category are only allowed until registration ends. Any further changes are possible only if approved by an organizer commissioned for this purpose by the head organizer of Fyziklani.</li>
                <li>If necessary, the head organizer may decide to move a team back to a lower category corresponding to its coefficient, or to move a team to category A. The team must be informed about this change one day before the competition at the latest.</li>
